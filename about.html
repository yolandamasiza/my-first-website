        <p>
            To see holiness and righteousness restored as God’s standard for life,

            according to God’s original design and purpose.

    <details>
        <summary>Our Mandate</summary>
        <p>
            We are called to demonstrate righteousness and holiness through transformed lives,
            serving as a light that guides, restores, and brings freedom where darkness has prevailed.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>
            “I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness.
            I will take hold of your hand.
            I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people
            and a light for the Gentiles,
            to open eyes that are blind,
            to free captives from prison
            and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.”
            </em>
            <br><br>
