    <h1>Who We Are</h1>

    <p>
        Mount Zion is a Christ-centered ministry called to model a life of
        <strong>holiness, righteousness, and spiritual maturity</strong>.
        We exist to reflect God’s character on the earth and to be a light
        to individuals, communities, and nations.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>

    <p>
        To see holiness and righteousness restored as God’s standard for life,
        influencing every sphere of creation —
        humanity, society, and the earth itself —
        in alignment with God’s original design and purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mandate</h2>

    <p>
        We are called to <strong>demonstrate righteousness and holiness</strong>
        through transformed lives, not merely through words.
        Our calling is rooted in God’s covenant purpose —
        to guide, restore, and bring light where darkness has prevailed.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <em>
        “I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness.
        I will take hold of your hand.
        I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people
        and a light for the Gentiles,
        to open eyes that are blind,
        to free captives from prison
        and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.”
        </em>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Isaiah 42:6–7</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
        At Mount Zion, following Jesus goes beyond belief —
        it is a journey of <strong>becoming like Him</strong>.
        We pursue a lifestyle that reflects Christ in character,
        conduct, and compassion.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Walk in Love</strong> — even when love is not returned (John 13:34)</li>
        <li><strong>Embrace Humility</strong> — choosing servanthood over status (Philippians 2:5–7)</li>
        <li><strong>Forgive Freely</strong> — even when forgiveness is costly (Luke 23:34)</li>
        <li><strong>Listen with Wisdom</strong> — allowing grace to shape our words (James 1:19)</li>
        <li><strong>Obey the Father</strong> — even when obedience requires sacrifice (John 4:34)</li>
        <li><strong>Live with Compassion</strong> — seeing people through God’s eyes (Matthew 9:36)</li>
        <li><strong>Grow in the Fruit of the Spirit</strong> — moving from flesh to fruit (Galatians 5:22–23)</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Self-Control</strong> — walking in the Spirit and overcoming the flesh
            (Proverbs 25:28; Galatians 5:16; 2 Timothy 1:7)
        </li>
    </ul>
